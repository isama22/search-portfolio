I was able to make an impact on almost every part of the site, but my most effective projects were in building modules that empowered their team to build new landing pages and populate them with a multitude of custom sections, reducing unecessary dev time. I owned both the 2021 and 2022 Impact Report pages, utilizing Shopify's JSON landing page builder feature; I designed the schemas and fleshed out the 7 sections and corresponding snippets that constitute those reports. They account for multiple kinds of content and styling, and can be found all across the site from sale and specialty landing pages to the home and product detail pages. I reported to the Project Manager, Designer, and Marketing Director weekly, and managed tasks with Trello, Asana, and Figma. + worked on performance and SEO auditing - preparing for new features that will replace old ones like INP and cinducting debugging / investigative work to improve scores in devtools",
